# Data Source Connectors

This directory contains the connector architecture for integrating various data sources into the platform.

## Architecture Overview

The connector system is designed to be extensible, allowing easy addition of new data source types. Each connector implements a common interface defined in `BaseConnector`.

## Creating a New Connector

To add support for a new data source type:

1. Create a new directory for your connector (e.g., `salesforce/`)
2. Create a connector class that extends `BaseConnector`
3. Add an `index.ts` file to export your connector
4. Include an `icon.svg` file for the web interface
5. The connector will be discovered by the runtime registry used by the API or lazily loaded by the sync registry.

### Example Connector Implementation

```typescript
import {
  BaseConnector,
  ConnectionTestResult,
  FetchOptions,
} from "../base/BaseConnector";

export class MyConnector extends BaseConnector {
  getMetadata() {
    return {
      name: "My Data Source",
      version: "1.0.0",
      description: "Connector for My Data Source",
      supportedEntities: ["entity1", "entity2"],
    };
  }

  async testConnection(): Promise<ConnectionTestResult> {
    // Implement connection test logic
    return {
      success: true,
      message: "Connection successful",
    };
  }

  getAvailableEntities(): string[] {
    return ["entity1", "entity2"];
  }

  async fetchEntity(options: FetchOptions): Promise<void> {
    const { entity, onBatch, onProgress, since } = options;

    // Implement data fetching logic
    // Call onBatch with each batch of records
    // Call onProgress to update progress
  }
}
```

### Connector Discovery

There are two registries:

- API runtime registry: scans subdirectories and dynamically imports connectors at runtime (`connectors/registry.ts`).
- Sync CLI registry: lazily imports connectors when needed (`sync/connector-registry.ts`).

Naming conventions are simplified; each connector exports a class named `XxxConnector` from its `index.ts`.

## Configuration

Data sources are stored in the database with encrypted credentials. Each data source has:

- **config**: Connection configuration (API keys, endpoints, etc.)
- **settings**: Sync settings (batch size, rate limits, etc.)
- **targetDatabases**: Target databases for syncing data

## Security

All sensitive configuration data (API keys, passwords, etc.) is encrypted before storage using AES-256-CBC encryption. The encryption key must be set in the `ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable.

## Available Connectors

### Stripe

- Syncs payment data from Stripe
- Supported entities: customers, subscriptions, charges, invoices, products, plans
- Required config: `api_key`

### Close

- Syncs CRM data from Close
- Supported entities: leads, opportunities, activities, contacts, users, custom_fields
- Required config: `api_key`

### GraphQL

- Generic GraphQL API connector
- Supports custom queries with offset or cursor pagination
- Required config: `endpoint`, `queries`

## Future Connectors

The architecture supports easy addition of new connectors such as:

- Salesforce
- HubSpot
- PostgreSQL/MySQL (direct database connections)
- REST APIs
- Webhooks
- CSV imports

## Contributing

When contributing a new connector:

1. Follow the existing patterns and interfaces
2. Include comprehensive error handling
3. Implement rate limiting and retry logic where appropriate
4. Add tests for your connector
5. Update this README with connector details
