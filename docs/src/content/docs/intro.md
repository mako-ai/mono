**Mako** is an AI-powered data platform designed to be the "Cursor for Data." It enables you to build a data warehouse by connecting to your existing databases and third-party data sources, and then use AI to write queries and analyze your data.

## Core Concept

Mako stacks four key components to solve the data fragmentation problem:

1.  **ETL Pipeline**: Connects to various data sources (Stripe, CRMs, Databases) and syncs data into a unified warehouse.
2.  **Database Client**: A universal interface to run queries across all your connected data.
3.  **AI Analyst**: An AI assistant equipped with tools to inspect schemas, write SQL, and explain results.
4.  **Collaboration**: A multi-tenant SaaS layer to share insights and queries with your team.

## Why Mako?

*   **Unified View**: Break down silos by pulling data from Stripe, Close.com, Postgres, and more into one place.
*   **AI-First**: Don't just run SQL; ask questions in plain English. Mako understands your schema.
*   **Open Source**: Built on modern open-source technologies. You own your data and your infrastructure.
*   **Extensible**: Add new data sources easily using the Connector SDK.

## Who is it for?

*   **CEOs/Founders**: Get answers to business questions without waiting for a data analyst.
*   **Data Analysts**: Automate the boring parts of ETL and query writing.
*   **Product Managers**: Make data-driven decisions with direct access to product metrics.
