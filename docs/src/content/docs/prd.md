## Executive Summary

Mako aims to be Cursor for Data. It is a AI powered data platform that allows you build a data warehouse by connecting to your existing data bases and third party data sources, then rely on AI to write queries and analyse your data. It is designed to be used by semi-technical users who are empowered by AI to build their own data solutions. It is an open source project that is also deployed as a multi-tenant SaaS product.

## Problem Statement

### Background

Let's say that a SaaS company wants to build a unified view of their customers in order to make better decisions.

### Problem Description

- Data live in different databases and data sources:
  -- Payment data lives in Stripe
  -- Customer data lives in the CRM (Salesforce, Hubspot, Close.com)
  -- Product data lives in the SaaS's own databse
  -- Analytics data lives in 3rd party analytics tools (GA4, PostHog, Mixpanel, etc.)
- Because the data lives in different places, it is not possible to join the data together to build a single view of the customer.
- For the data that lives in a third party database, it is not possible to write queries to analyse the data.
- Even after the data is joined together in a datawarehouse, the users still needs to access it with a SQL client or a BI tool before they can start analysing the data.
- Even after they have connected to their data, they still need to write queries to analyse the data.
- Even if they can copy/paste between ChatGPT and a SQL client, an external LLM doesn't have access to the data schema, the actual data or the data warehouse. It can't test the queries or the results.
- Even once the company has a functioning datawarehouse, a set of nice queries, they still need to be able to share them with the rest of the company, and keep track of changes.

## Solution

Mako solves all of these challenges by stacking the following components:

- An ETL pipeline that allows to connect to a variety of existing data bases and third party apis and sync the data to a data warehouse.
- A database client that allows to connect to every type of database and run queries on the data.
- An AI assistant with access to the data warehouse with tools like inspect_schema and execute_query that can help the user write queries and analyse the data.
- A multi-tenant SaaS product that allows to customize the prompt and share your queries with the rest of the company.

### Impact

By getting all of the data in a single place and making it accessible to AI, the user can start to build a unified view of their customers, products, sales, marketing, etc. and get answers to questions like:

- Who are my best customers?
- Which customers are at risk of churning?
- What products are most popular?
- Who are my top salespeople?

The goal is not only to make it possible to answer these questions, but also to make the process of building these solutions as easy as possible. Getting these answers should be 100x faster thanks to AI and automation.

## Goals and Objectives

### Primary Goals

1. Build a data warehouse that allows to connect to a variety of existing data bases and third party apis and sync the data to a data warehouse.
2. Build a database client that allows to connect to every type of database and run queries on the data.
3. Build an AI assistant with access to the data warehouse with tools like inspect_schema and execute_query that can help the user write queries and analyse the data.
4. Build a multi-tenant SaaS product that allows to customize the prompt and share your queries with the rest of the company.
5. Publish the product as an open source project that can be used by anyone easily.

### Success Metrics

- **Metric 1:** Companies using Mako to build a data warehouse and use AI to analyse their data.
- **Metric 2:** The product is used by 1000 companies.
- **Metric 3:** The project has 1000 stars on GitHub.

### Non-Goals

- We will not build a data warehouse from scratch. We will use existing data warehouses like Snowflake, BigQuery, etc.
