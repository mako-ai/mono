# Engineering Ops

- Logging: follow [LOGTAPE_IMPLEMENTATION.md](mdc:LOGTAPE_IMPLEMENTATION.md); prefer structured logs and include workspace IDs.
- Testing auth: use [AUTH_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md](mdc:AUTH_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md) when adding/changing protected routes.
- Database migrations: see [DATABASE_MIGRATION.md](mdc:DATABASE_MIGRATION.md) and update schemas accordingly.
- Console API docs: [CONSOLE_API_DOCUMENTATION.md](mdc:CONSOLE_API_DOCUMENTATION.md) for integration boundaries.

Rules:

- Do not log secrets, API keys, or tokens.
- Fail fast on configuration errors; validate required env at startup.
- Prefer background processing (Inngest) for slow operations.
