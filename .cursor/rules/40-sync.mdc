# Sync Guidelines

- Architecture: [docs/Chunked-Sync-Architecture.md](mdc:docs/Chunked-Sync-Architecture.md), [SYNC_WORKER_ARCHITECTURE.md](mdc:SYNC_WORKER_ARCHITECTURE.md).
- Migration and refactors: [SYNC_INNGEST_MIGRATION.md](mdc:SYNC_INNGEST_MIGRATION.md), [SYNC_REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md](mdc:SYNC_REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md), [SYNC_SCHEDULING_IMPLEMENTATION.md](mdc:SYNC_SCHEDULING_IMPLEMENTATION.md).
- Entry points: [api/src/sync](mdc:api/src/sync) and compiled [dist/sync.js](mdc:dist/sync.js).

Rules:

- Use chunked sync pattern; avoid long blocking operations in a single job.
- Delegate connector-specific logic to `api/src/connectors/**`.
- All sync jobs should be idempotent and checkpoint progress (by cursor/offset) per workspace.
- Prefer Inngest for scheduling/triggering; avoid ad-hoc timers.
