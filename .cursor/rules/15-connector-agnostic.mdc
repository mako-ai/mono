# Connector Agnosticism & Schema-Driven UI

Purpose: Ensure adding a new connector requires only dropping a new folder under `api/src/connectors/**` and exposing a schema; no app code outside that folder needs changes.

Rules:

- Connectors must be 100% self-contained under `api/src/connectors/<type>/`.
- UI must be schema-driven: forms render using the schema returned by `/api/connectors/:type/schema`.
- Do NOT hardcode connector-specific logic in shared components (e.g., `app/src/components/**`), routes, or services.
- If conditional fields are needed, use schema properties like `showIf` and `type: "select"` with `options`; never add branching by connector type in UI code.
- Connector registration happens via registries; adding a connector should not require editing the UI or non-registry backend files.
- Keep any connector-specific data transformations inside the connector implementation.

Enforcement guidance:

- During reviews, reject edits that add `if (type === "xyz")` checks outside connector folders.
- Prefer updating connector schemas over UI code to change field order, visibility, or control types.
