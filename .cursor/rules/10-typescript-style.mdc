# TypeScript & React Guidelines

- Prefer explicit types for exported APIs; avoid `any`.
- Use early returns and guard clauses; keep nesting shallow.
- Handle errors meaningfully; do not swallow exceptions.
- Follow descriptive naming (functions are verbs, variables are nouns). Avoid abbreviations.
- Keep comments short and explain "why", not "how". Avoid inline noise.
- Match existing formatting and do not reformat unrelated code in edits.
- Frontend: co-locate components under `app/src/components/**` and hooks under `app/src/hooks/**`.
- Backend: group routes under `api/src/routes/**` and services under `api/src/services/**`.
